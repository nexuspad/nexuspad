Hi, I'm Ren Liu and this is my code playground.

I develop both frontend and backend code using Java, Javascript, Dart with libraries like Spring framework, VueJs, AngularJs, React and Flutter.
I'm also a big fan of Python and try to use it for some quick data processing or analysis as much as possible.

I also own nexuspad.com and findmyroof.com. They both are developed using VueJs for frontend and Spring boot backend.
