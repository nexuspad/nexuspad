Hi, I'm Ren Liu and this is my code playground.

I develop both frontend and backend code using Java, Javascript, Flutter with libraries like Spring framework, VueJs, AngularJs, and React.
I'm also a big fan of Python and try to use the tool as much as possible.

I developed nexuspad.com and findmyroof.com. They both are sitting on VueJs + Spring boot backend architecture.
